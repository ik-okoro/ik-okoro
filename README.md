Hi there 👋, thanks for stopping by, my name is **Ik** and I'm an aspiring ML Engineer that loves breaking down challenges (and defeating them haha).

I love building predictive models that could answer business questions or help provide further insight to a topic. I usually code in Python but I've been trying my hand in C# and HTML/CSS. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on -> FastAPI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning -> AWS
- 📫 You can find me on -> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ik-okoro-ml-engineer)
- ⚡ Fun fact -> I'm incredibly athletic
